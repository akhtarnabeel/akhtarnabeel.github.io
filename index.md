I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.bu.edu/cs/) at [Boston University](http://www.bu.edu). I joined CS@BU in Fallâ€™13. 
<br />
At BU, I am working with [Prof. Ibrahim Matta](http://sites.bu.edu/matta/). 
My areas of interests are Computer Networks, Network Virtualization, Network Softwarization, Future Internet Architectures and Network Optimization.
