I am interested in Network Virtualization. I am working on resource allocation problems
for Network Function Virtualization, 
Virtual Function placement and routing problem, Elastic management of resources for virtual functions.
I am also looking at "serverless computing" and "microservices". 

<!--- #### [EL-SEC: ELastic Management of SECurity Applications on Virtualized Infrastructure](https://github.com/akhtarnabeel/ELSEC)  – Spring 2015 to present
- Advisers: Prof. Ibrahim Matta
- Concepts from Control theory and SDN (Software Defined Networking) are used for NFV (Network Function Virtualization) elastic management and deployment.

#### Network Function Placement, Orchestration and Management - Spring 2016 - present
- Advisers: Prof. Ibrahim Matta
- NFV placement and traffic routing problem.
	
#### [Recursive InterNetwork Architecture (RINA)](http://csr.bu.edu/rina/)     – Fall 2013 to present
- Advisers: Prof. Ibrahim Matta
- RINA is a new network architecture that is based on the fundamental principle that networking is inter-process communication (IPC). It recurses the IPC service over different scopes.

#### [Analysis of realistic Channel Models for VANETs](../projects/proj1.html)     – Fall 2011 to Spring 2013
- Advisers: Dr. Sinem Ergen and Dr. Oznur Ozkasap
- This project deals with analyzing different channel models and proposing a realistic model for vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET).

#### [Realistic Mobility Modeling for VANETs](../projects/proj2.html) – Fall 2011 to Spring 2013
- Advisers: Dr. Sinem Ergen and Dr. Oznur Ozkasap
- In this project, we integrate real-world road topology and real-time data extracted from the Freeway Performance Measurement System (PeMS) database into the microscopic mobility model in order to generate realistic traffic flows along the highway.

#### [Distributed Algorithms for density estimation in VANETs](../projects/proj3.html)     – Summer 2012 to Spring 2013
- Advisers: Dr. Sinem Ergen and Dr. Oznur Ozkasap
- The project deals with proposing fully distributed and infrastructure-free mechanisms for the density estimation in vehicular ad-hoc networks. This study is inspired by the mechanisms proposed for system size estimation in peer-to-peer networks.

#### Providing VANET security through group based approach     – Fall 2010 to Spring 2011
- Advisers: Dr. Fareed Zaffar
- The project deals with security aspects in VANETs. We analysed existing frameworks for providing security and proposed a more efficient framework for evaluating security.

#### Shortest path traffic flow optimization in VANETs     – Summer 2011
- Advisers: Dr. Fareed Zaffar
- The project deals with computing the shortest path for vehicles using heuristic data and active query caching. Road-side units (RSU) were used to assign weights to different paths and A-star algorithm was then used to compute the shortest path using distance-plus-cost heuristic function.

#### Development and Analysis of P2P Network Size Estimation     – Summer 2010
- Advisers: Dr. Oznur Ozkasap
- In this project, we analysed and implemented distributed algorithm for network size estimation in P2P networks using Planet-Lab as the underlying test bed.

#### Color-based feature matching to track objects in consecutive video frames     – 2010
- Advisers: Dr. Sohaib Khan
- **Best Project Award** at International Conference on Machine Vision (ICMV 2010)
- In this project, RBG-pixel based matching and SIFT algorithm were used with trajectory to track a frame in a live video feed. Different augmented reality effects were then generated within the frame using a completely automated process.
